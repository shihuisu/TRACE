      <p>That day after class, I sat alone on the curb outside the learning node. A boy was drawing on the pavement with chalk. Slow, careful lines. Shapes that disappeared under the soles of passing shoes. I watched him for a long time. Something about the slowness felt sacred.</p>

        <p>Downstairs in the back of an abandoned library, behind a shelf of dusty instruction manuals, someone had left a note taped to the wall:</p>
        <p><i>“Read tonight. No devices.”</i></p>
        <p>Just that.</p>
        <p>I followed the sound of whispering. Through cracked tiles and shadowed stairwells, I walked into the quiet.</p>
        <p>The walls buzzed faintly — like they remembered. Not noise, but the memory of noise. My footsteps felt louder than they should have. Every corner of that space carried the feeling of being watched, not by people, but by time.</p>

      It started with brief disruptions. Flickers. Static. Forgotten names.  
      I thought it was fatigue, but it spread—small memories scattered like dust.

      Without the upgrade, the neural cloud began to destabilize. Files once intact  
      dissolved into fragments. I tried to recall—tried to grasp—  
      but all I saw were flashes...
